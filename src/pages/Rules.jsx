          GENSHIN RANKED is a CO-OP 3v3 gamemode where players are organized in
          teams of 3 to fight a series of bosses. Whichever team can kill the
          bosses faster will win.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>DIVISIONS:</p>
        <p>
          Currently, there are THREE different divisions: OPEN, ADVANCED, and
          PREMIER. These divisions are separated based off of INVESTMENT, and
          units in the same division should perform similarly. During any
          division match, all players may only use characters and weapons within
          that division OR a lower division. <br /> Refer to the characters
          section on this website to determine your division. If you need
          assistance, please join the DISCORD SERVER (discord.gg/fnGdP36E2Q) and
          ask a member to help!

        <p>
          RANKED has 2 different gamemodes: DRAFT PICK and BLIND PICK DRAFT PICK
          involves banning different characters for BOTH teams. Additionally,
          the character picks across teams may NOT overlap. BLIND PICK involves
          each team picking a set of characters to use, with no bans. Character
          picks across teams may overlap. It is generally recommended for newer
          players to start with BLIND PICK, but the game may be played however
          you wish. HAVE FUN!
