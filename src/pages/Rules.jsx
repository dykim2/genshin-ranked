    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>

      <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>DIVISIONS: </p>
    </b>
    <p style={{ fontSize: "12px" }}>
      Currently, there are THREE different divisions:
      <span style="color:lightgreen;"> OPEN, </span> <span style="color:yellow;">ADVANCED, </span> and <span style="color:red;">PREMIER</span>. These divisions are separated based
      off of INVESTMENT, and units in the same division should perform similarly. During any division match, all players
      may only use characters and weapons within that division OR a lower division. <br /> Refer to the <a
        href="Characters.html"> <span style="color:wheat;">characters </span></a>
      section on this website to determine your division. If you need assistance, please join the DISCORD SERVER
      (discord.gg/fnGdP36E2Q) and ask a member to help!
      <br />
      <span style="color:lightgreen;"> Open  </span>division is intended for the casual genshin player who has just gotten to the end of the game. this division has many characters to allow for a wide variety of picks and a low damage ceiling to accommodate unique team compositions. you'll see a lot of characters with their signature weapon restricted.<br />
      <span style="color:yellow;">Advanced </span> division is targeted towards the endgame player who's been farming artifacts and primogems for about a year. spiral abyss is not even a challenge anymore, and all the characters in the roster are built out with signatures and maybe a constellation or two. a lot of "standard" best-in-slot character builds are seen here. <br />
    <span style="color:red;">Premier </span>division is for the decadent enthusiast who stops at nothing to ensure their favorites and their account receive the best treatment possible. the investment in these characters either contributes to an overwhelming amount of personal damage or enables other players to hit far above their normal expected damage. every option is allowed in premier.
    </p>

    <p><b>GENERAL DRAFT RULES: </b> <br />
      <span style="color:lightgreen;"> Open  </span>division: 7 bosses, 8 minutes of prep time
      <br /> <span style="color:yellow;">Advanced </span> division: 7 bosses, 8 minutes of prep time
      <br /> <span style="color:red;">Premier </span> division: 9 bosses, 5 minutes of prep time</p>

      RANKED has 2 different gamemodes: <span style="color:tomato;">DRAFT PICK</span> and <span
        style="color:lightblue;">BLIND PICK</span>.
      <br />DRAFT PICK involves banning different characters for BOTH teams. Additionally,
      the character picks across teams may NOT overlap. <br />BLIND PICK involves
      each team picking a set of characters to use, with no bans. Character
      picks across teams may overlap. <br />It is generally recommended for newer
      players to start with BLIND PICK, but the game may be played however
      you wish. <br />HAVE FUN!

    showcase your selected build on character profile and you may start with desired hp and energy designate yourself as
    ready with "r" or "ready." Ref will then type "Timer is ready, you have 15 seconds to begin" and you shall kill the
