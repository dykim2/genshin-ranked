          GENSHIN RANKED is a CO-OP 3v3 gamemode where players are organized in
          teams of 3 to fight a series of bosses. Whichever team can kill the
          bosses faster will win.

        </b>
        <p style={{ fontsize: "12px" }}>
          Currently, there are THREE different divisions:{" "}
          <span style={{ color: "lightgreen" }}>OPEN, </span>
          <span style={{ color: "yellow" }}>ADVANCED, </span>
          and <span style={{ color: "red" }}>PREMIER</span>
          . These divisions are separated based off of INVESTMENT, and units in
          the same division should perform similarly. During any division match,
          all players may only use characters and weapons within that division
          OR a lower division.

          RANKED has 2 different gamemodes:{" "}
          <span style={{ color: "tomato" }}>DRAFT PICK</span> and
          <span style={{ color: "lightblue" }}> BLIND PICK</span>
          <br />
          DRAFT PICK involves banning different characters for BOTH teams.
          Additionally, the character picks across teams may NOT overlap.
          <br />
          BLIND PICK involves each team picking a set of characters to use, with
          no bans. Character picks across teams may overlap.
          <br />
          It is generally recommended for newer players to start with BLIND
          PICK, but the game may be played however you wish.
