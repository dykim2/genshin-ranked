## What is Genshin Ranked?

A 3v3 game mode that allows players to draft bosses and characters to play against each other in co=op in the game Genshin Impact.

This website handles the draft and is a hub for all of the gamemode's information. 

## How do I create a game?
Go to the PLAY tab, select "CREATE NEW GAME" and choose which player you want to be. By default, you will want to choose either player 1, player 2, or ref.

## How do I join a game?
Ask the player who created the game for the room ID. Navigate to the PLAY tab and select "JOIN EXISTING GAME" and choose the room ID and player accordingly. If you just want to watch, choose "Spectator" as your player.

## how can I view what characters and bosses can be drafted?
Go to the BOSSES and CHARACTERS tabs to see a character's restrictions based on constellation!

## Does this work on mobile too?
Yes!

## What tech stack did you use to create the game?
The frontend uses TypeScript (formerly JavaScript) combined with React, Redux, and Material UI for state management and display components. The backend uses ExpressJS combined with a REST API used to create games and a Websocket used to run games. Both are coded in Javascript.
